> Please use the below questions as guidelines to help you think and plan your Learning Reflection Report

## 1. How was your experience testing the given Webapp?
- At first the instructions seemed a bit confusing.
- I think I understood the assignment after reading the instructions a few times and looking at the files.
     

## 2. How did you write or manage your test case? Describe the process.
- I simply followed the provided example and the instructions on each file.
- When writing the test cases I was thinking what would constitute a minimum viable product (MVP).
- For 05_IssuePage I came up with additional tests because the instructions didn't quite cover MVP functionality.
    

## 3. Do you recommend any other tools or styles for Test case management. 
- 


## 4. Which IDE (Visual Code or Atom or else) have you used to edit files?
- Visual Studio Code.


     
## 5. Did you find any trouble? how did you solve the trouble?
- No trouble.


## 6. Did you find any trouble using Github? have you used Github before? where?
- No trobuble.
- I have used Github and Gitlab before.
- Mostly for work, programming related. Occasionally for hobbies like programming and Linux related stuff.
 

      

## 7. If in the future if you need to automate these test cases, which framework or language will you use? and describe why (Robot Framework, Cypress, Selenium, or any other )
- Pick the tools that work for the programming language, other tools being used for the project and the team (if there is a team).
- YAML is used as the configuration language for GitHub and Gitlab test automation.
- For a Python project, one might use pytest as a test framework. It is a common test framework for Python, but for projects written in another programming language it could be only used for black-box testing.
- Similarly Cypress mentioned above is for Javascript web apps.
- Selenium is for automating the actions user may take in a web browser. Many test frameworks can make use of Selenium, such as Cypress. It is relevant should the project be a web app, but wouldn't ne helpful for a console app or backend systems.
- I wasn't familiar with the Robot Framework, but its syntax seems identical to the example test case. Seems like it is useful for acceptance testing.


## 8. Kindly search the term `Tester` `Automation Tester` glassdoor and LinkedIn or any other job search website. Currently, list the skills and competencies that are most in-demand in software testing
- Hands-on experience with low-code/no-code automation tools
- Expertise in automation frameworks and API testing
- Proficiency in scripting languages (Python, Java)
- Experience with CI/CD pipelines and cloud-based test environments
- Design, write, and maintain comprehensive test cases and defect reports.
- Identify, reproduce, and document bugs and inconsistencies, following through to resolution.
- Strong analytical and problem-solving mindset with critical thinking skills.
- Strong organizational and time management abilities to handle multiple tasks under strict deadlines.
- Collaborative approach to working with cross-functional teams and stakeholders.


## 9. **Let's assume** that if you are going to continue with the career in Software Testing, which technical and soft skills do you need to fill up the blank in your resume?
- CI/CD, but I should be more familiar with those by end of 2026 due to increasing software quality requirements at job.
- Practical experience in test tools (both manual and automation).




## 10. Write short Learning Reflection and  Free words Do you think that project helped in putting theoretical knowledge into practice? Describe? (is there anything else that you would like to share with us concerning the current study module). e.g. regarding the quality of content and your learning (or) improvement ideas? 
- Even though I have extensive work history in the IT-industry, I've never had formal training in software testing.
- As such, this course was a good introduction to fundamentals of software testing.
- Much of it is simply attention to detail and common sense. 
- It helps to understand the terminology and common methods.
- While it is unlikely I will be a software tester, the things I learned in this course can make me a better developer.
- The last test in the Canvas was too long I think. It can really come as a surprise how long it takes. Perhaps it could be split into two.
